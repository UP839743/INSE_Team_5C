# FDB (Football DataBase) By INSE Team 5c

Hi there, this project aims to get football fans all the statistics they could ever need on a easy to use desktop application (Windows only at this point, MAC support will come at some point) Note: MySQl is the only supported datasbase language currently.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Basic Mode - Application requests data from remote database on the internet (Currently Unavalible, due to not being able to host it anywhere)
```
No Extra requirements right now...
```

Advanced Mode - Downloading the database and running it on your local machine (Only mode avalible right now)
```
* [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) - used to store the database and run the local server
```

For Developer Mode - Want to edit the code yourself? Great! 
```
* [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) - used to store the database and run the local server
* [MySQL Java Connector](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) - The connector for java and the MySQL Database NEtbeans (Recommended IDE will nee)
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
